<h1>Motivation and Questions</h1>
<p>When our group was brainstorming what our final Data Science project would be, we started by looking for large public health-related datasets that were available on the web. We quickly found data about hospital rankings and comparisons from <a href="https://data.medicare.gov/data/hospital-compare">Medicare</a>, and decided it would be interesting to analyze the hospital rankings based on factors like geography, type of hospital ownership, and some of the criteria used to create the rankings. Upon doing some further reading, we learned that the roll-out of these Medicare Hospital Compare rankings in July 2016 was <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-07-27/medicare-releases-controversial-hospital-star-ratings">controversial</a>. Many hospitals criticized the rankings, claiming that these scores were not accurate. Furthermore, there were complaints that major hospitals that consistently score highly in US News and World Reports rankings and other commercial rankings did not score highly on the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/07/27/487633215/many-well-known-hospitals-fail-to-score-high-in-medicare-rankings">Medicare rankings</a>, and instead relatively obscure hospitals received the highest rating (a rating of 5 stars). Given this information, we decided to analyze the Medicare data assess these claims. Questions that drove our analysis were:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What was the geographic distribution of ratings? Did areas of the country that are known for having well-known hospital systems (eg NYC, Boston) have high Medicare scores? In what areas of the country were there hospitals with the lowest scores?</p></li>
<li><p>How did the distribution of ratings vary by hospital ownership type?</p></li>
<li><p>Were there important differences in the Top 20 Hospitals in 2016-2017 as ranked by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160816171510/http://health.usnews.com/health-care/best-hospitals/articles/best-hospitals-honor-roll-and-overview">US News and World Reports</a> and the corresponding 2016 Medicare scores for these hospitals (i.e. were the complaints of these hospitals justified)?</p></li>
<li><p>Can we make a logistic model for patient satisfaction score based on other known hospital ranking criteria?</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level1">
<h1>Data</h1>
<p><strong>Medicare Hospital Data</strong></p>
<p><em>Data source and cleaning</em></p>
<p>The initial dataset that we used was downloaded as a csv file from <a href="https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Hospital-General-Information/xubh-q36u/data">Data.Medicare.gov</a> by clicking on the “Export” tab and selecting the CSV option from the Download section, which allowed us to download a copy of the dataset in a static format.</p>
<p>In order to make a plot of the geographic distribution of hospital rankings, we needed to have the latitude and longitude of the hospitals; this information was provided in the “Location” variable, but as a coordinate pair, and with the accompanying address. To address this, we applied the <code>separate</code> function twice, first to separate <code>coordinates</code> and <code>address</code>, and then to separate <code>coordinates</code> into <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code>.</p>
<p>However, when we looked through the resulting dataset, we noticed that there were quite a few hospitals that didn’t have latitude and longitude coordinates, which would prohibit us from being able to plot them on a map. To address this, we applied the <code>geocode</code> function from the <code>ggmap</code> package to the dataset, which takes an input address and provides the corresponding latitude and longitude.</p>
<p>We first applied <code>ggmap::geocode</code> using the <code>address</code> variable to look up coordinates; however after running this, we still had several hospitals for which it wasn’t able to find coordinates. So we then did the same thing, but using <code>hospital_name</code> as the input address information to try to find the coordinates for the hospitals that we had missed using <code>address</code>. After applying this process, there were only 4 hospitals for which we could not find corresponding geographical coordinates; since none of these were major, well-known hospitals, we removed them from the dataset. We then joined this dataset to our initial hospital dataset to replace the missing latitude and longitude values. We saved this updated dataset, which contained geographic coordinates for all of the hospitals as a csv file called <code>hospital_data_2</code> and used this dataset for all of our analyses.</p>
<p>need to have an explanation of score normalization</p>
<p>Exploratory analysis: Visualizations, summaries, and exploratory statistical analyses. Justify the steps you took, and show any major changes to your ideas. Additional analysis: If you undertake formal statistical analyses, describe these in detail Discussion: What were your findings? Are they what you expect? What insights into the data can you make?</p>
